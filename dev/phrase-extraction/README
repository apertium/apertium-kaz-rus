This package provides a set of tools for the automatic generation of
shallow-transfer machine translation (MT) rules from parallel
corpora. Transfer rules are generated from alignment templates, like
those used in statistical machine translation, that have been
extracted from parallel corpora and extended with a set of
restrictions controlling their application. The generate transfer
rules (in XML format) can be directly used by the Apertium MT platform
(http://www.apertium.org). Although this package is aimed at the
generation of Apertium transfer rules it can be adapted to generate
shallow-transfer rules for other MT platforms. Moreover, some of the
tools it provides can be used for other purposes such as the
extraction of bilingual phrase pairs or the symmetrization of
previously computed alignments. This package depends on the GIZA++
toolkit (http://www.fjoch.com/GIZA++.html) to compute word
alignments; nevertheless, it can be easily adapted to use other
aligners.
